<p class="style2">September 2008</p>
<p>Well, I have managed to keep the site fairly updated as far as my artwork is concerned. I still don't have some of my other pages up, but I am working on it. I just end up getting distracted by other things. This year is steadily seeing me pick back up more and more of my artwork, and I am enjoying it quite a lot. I am still striving to get better and learn new techniques.</p>
<p>Some news... I am currently working on a new art project that will be taking up most of my time, though I do plan to squeeze a few of my own works in there. The project is large and should be incredibly awesome if it can come to completion. I can't say too much about it at the present time, but I'll add updates about it when I can.</p>
<p>Commission status is pretty much closed because of this large project, however I am still open to entertaining possibilities so do contact me if anyone would like to.</p>
<p>Thank you for stopping in!  </p>

<p class="style2">A new year, a new web site...</p>
<p>Lunar Labyrinth has been up for quite a number of years, and has not been updated in just as long. I attempted to update it in 2005, but I never got around to finishing the task. I over complicated my gallery set up and subsequently spent months having to create each individual image page. This time, I'm going to attempt to use some software to help me do some of that instead. That, and I don't have as complicated a gallery set up either. </p>
<p>I've completely removed the old site, and will get this one up as quickly as I can. Please pardon the mess while I am in the process of rebuilding everything. If there was something on the old site that you need or have questions about, please just drop me a line.</p>
<p>Just as before this site is dedicated to my absolute love for art and writing. Some of my writing will be on this site, though as I've improved since the other site was up, I won't be putting up everything that was there before. I'll also be regularly updating information about my book that I am working on. Mason Square hasn't seen many words added lately, mainly due to lack of time... my son was born November 7th, 2006, and has been keeping me on my toes ever since.</p>
<p>My art I seem to find a bit more time for, though not much. So there are much more regular updates to my galleries than anything else. I'm also this time going to include a photography gallery. I didn't have that last time, but I've captured a number of images I'd really like to have up.</p>
<p>Thank you for visiting and I hope you enjoy the site. If you have any questions or comments please feel free to drop me a line. All of my contact information is available under the link for it. </p>
